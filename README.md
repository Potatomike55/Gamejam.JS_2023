# Gamedev.JS Jam 2023

Initially started as a submission for the Gamedev.js Jam 2023
After missing the deadline due to poor time management by the programmer and project director (me), this git repo represents the current progress of the project.
Download the HTML, CSS, and JS files as well as the /images directory and open the HTML file in your web browser to test the app.
